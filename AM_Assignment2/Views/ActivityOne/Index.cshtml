<h2>HTML5 Semantics</h2>

<p>HTML5 semantics are preferred over basic html semantics.</p>

<p>Semantic elements are tags that provide information about what they are or what they will store.</p>
<p>For example: "div" and "span" are non-semantic, whereas "Form", "Table", and "Article" are semantic as it says what it is.</p>
<p>These are preferred over non-semantic as coders like to know what to put and where to put it.</p>
